This is just a simple Password Cracker which uses a text file (contains a list of passwords that are used commonly) as a Bruteforce approach to cracking passwords on zip files.


Although one can just use the command `python Frontend.py` to execute the application, but if someone wants an executable, he/she can create one by using **pyinstaller**.
Follow as:-
<br>
`pip install pyinstaller`
<br>
Now Navigate to the folder in which both the python scripts are and open a terminal in the folder.
In the terminal, enter:
<br>
`pyinstaller Frontend.exe --onefile -w`
  <br>
This will create a folder named 'build' and 'dist'.
The dist folder will contain the .exe file and you can use it anywhere on your PC by creating a shortcut to the main .exe file itself.
